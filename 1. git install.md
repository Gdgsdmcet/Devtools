# Quick Demo

This demo will guide you through the following steps:  
- Setting up Git on Windows  
- Configuring Git for Windows  
- Creating a GitHub account  
- Initializing a repository (repo)  
- Pushing the code to a repository  

---

## 1. Setting Up Git on Windows  

1. Download Git from the official website: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/).  
2. Run the installer and follow these steps:  
   - Select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt."  
   - Keep other default options unless needed.  
3. Once installed, verify the installation:  
   ```bash
   git --version
   
## 2. Configuring Git for Windows
After installation, configure your username and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

To verify the configuration:

```bash
git config --list
```

## 3. Creating a GitHub Account
Go to GitHub and sign up for a free account.
Confirm your email address to activate your account.

## 4. Initializing a Repository
Create a folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Initialize Git in the folder:

```bash
git init
```

Add a new file to the folder (e.g., README.md):

```bash
mkdir filename
```

Stage the file for commit:

```bash
git add README.md
```

Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## 5. Pushing the Code to a Repository
Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking the "+" icon and selecting New Repository.

Follow the instructions to add the GitHub remote URL to your local repository:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
Verify the code is pushed by visiting your repository on GitHub.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up Git and pushed your first project to GitHub! ðŸš€
