2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the repository page.  
3. The forked repository will now appear in your GitHub account.

## 2. Cloning a Repository  

1. Copy the URL of your forked repository. Click the green **Code** button and copy the HTTPS URL.  
2. Open a terminal or Git Bash and run the following command:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   
Navigate into the cloned repository folder:

```bash
cd repo-name
```
## 3. Making Changes
Open the repository folder in your favorite code editor.

Edit or create files as needed.

Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## 4. Making Pull Requests (PR)
Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
Click the Pull Requests tab.
Click New Pull Request and compare your forked repositoryâ€™s branch to the original repositoryâ€™s branch.
Add a title and description, then click Create Pull Request.

## 5. Accepting Pull Requests (PR)
If you are the repository owner, go to the Pull Requests tab of your repository.
Review the changes by clicking the Files Changed tab.
If everything looks good, click Merge Pull Request, then Confirm Merge.
You can optionally delete the branch after merging.

Happy collaborating! ðŸš€
